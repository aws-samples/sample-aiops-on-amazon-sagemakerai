## AWS AIOps on SageMakerAI 

This repository contains a collection of examples and resources to help you operationalize Generative AI (GenAI) and Machine learning workloads on SageMakerAI.

### Overview
The AWS AIOps covering GenAIOps and MLOps patterns involing SageMakerAI resources like SageMaker managed MLflow, SageMaker pipelines and include all other AWS GenAI related features like Amazon Bedrock. This repository provides a set of sample notebooks, scripts, and configurations to help you explore different aspects of the AIOps.
