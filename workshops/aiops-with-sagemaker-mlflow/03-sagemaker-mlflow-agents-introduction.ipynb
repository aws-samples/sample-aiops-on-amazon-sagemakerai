    "In this notebook lab, you will develop an IT support agent where the agent is designed for taking user IT support questions, automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) of the support tickets and provide actionable resolution to the user question. The support tickets are regarding issues of an IT system and the support agent helps users with ticket resolution. This intelligent agent is implemented via the LangGraph framework and instrumented with MLflow tracing, demonstrating how modern agentic architectures can elevate IT system incident response and operational reliability.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is the ideal resolution steps:  \n",
    "1. The user requests assistance by providing a `ticket_id`.\n",
    "2. The agent calls the `log_identifier` tool to classify the error from backend logs associated with the ticket.\n",
    "3. The agent invokes the information_retriever tool to fetch detailed solution steps based on error type and context.\n",
