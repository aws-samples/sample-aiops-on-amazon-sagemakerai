    "Most of our MLflow configurations exist in our training script `sft.py`. This is where we import the MLflow library, set our tracking server, name our experiments and runs and log artifiacts, parameters, and metrics. MLflow has direct integration with Huggingface Transformers library to make it easy to setup. \n",

    "## Setting Up MLflow\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install mlflow\n",
    "pip install mlflow-sagemaker\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second package is needed to set a tracking server in SageMaker with an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Once these two packages are installed you import the mlflow library and set the tracking URI to your SageMaker tracking server and name your experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mlflow\n",
    "\n",
    "mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"your_sagemaker_tracking_uri\")\n",
    "mlflow.set_experiment(\"your_experiment_name\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you need to start a run. A run can be a fine-tuning job or an evaluation job. Runs can be nested with a parent child relationship to remember which jobs are related to each other. Once you have initiated a run you can log different items to MLflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mlflow.start_run(run_name='training-job-1') as run:\n",
    "    trainer.train()\n",
    "    mlflow.log_metrics('loss': 0.05)\n",
    "    mlflow.log_param(\"learning_rate\", 0.01)\n",
    "    mlflow.log_artifact('recipe.yaml')\n",
